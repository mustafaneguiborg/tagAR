Current Version 3.0
Changes Since Version 2.1

This new version boasts new features such as facebook connectivity. Users now will be able to login (and automatically register
) into the app via their facebook account. Furthermore they will be able to use new features which will be only be available
for them. User will also be able to login via the old native method, but they will not be able to use the facebook features.
However they will be able to link their facebook account to the tagAR account. 

I also have made a change in the server code where a security risk was discovered. We have patched up that risk now and Version 3.0
will use this new code.
